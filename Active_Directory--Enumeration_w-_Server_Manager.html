    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Enumeration w/ Server Manager</h1><br/>             Because servers are  hardly ever logged on unless its for maintenance this gives you an easy  way for enumeration only using the built in windows features such as the  server manager. If you already have domain admin you have a lot of  access to the server manager in order to change trusts, add or remove  users, look at groups, this can be an entry point to find other users  with other sensitive information on their machines or find other users  on the domain network with access to other networks in order to pivot to  another network and continue your testing.<br />The only way to access the server manager is to rdp into the server and access the server over an rdp connection<br />We&#39;ll  only be going over the basics such as looking at users, groups, and  trusts however there are a lot of other mischief that you can get your  hands on in terms of enumerating with the server manager<br />This can also be a way of easily identifying what kind of firewall the network is using if you have not already enumerated it.<br /><h2>Connect to the VM w/ RDP:</h2><br /><br /><h2>Enumeration w/ Server Manager -</h2><br />This  is what Windows Server Manager will look when you first open it up the  main tabs that will be most interesting are the tools and manage tabs  the tools tab is where you will find most of your information such as  users, groups, trusts, computers. The manage tab will allow you to add  roles and features however this will probably get picked up by a systems  admin relatively quick.<br />Dont worry about the AD  CS, AD DS, DNS, or File and Storage Services these are setup for  exploitation of the active directory and dont have much use for  post-exploitation<br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/xk3fAdg.png"><img src="images/78-1.png" alt="images/78-1.png" /></a><br />Navigate to the tools tab and select the Active Directory Users and Computers<a href="https://i.imgur.com/LbWxEF5.png"><img src="images/78-2.png" alt="images/78-2.png" /></a><br />This will pull up a list of all users on the domain as well as some other useful tabs to use such as groups and computers<br />Some  sys admins dont realize that you as an attacker can see the  descriptions of user accounts so they may set the service accounts  passwords inside of the description look into the description and find  what the SQL Service password is<br /><br />        <br /></div></body></html>
