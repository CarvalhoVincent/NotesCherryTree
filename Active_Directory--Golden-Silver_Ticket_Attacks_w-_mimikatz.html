If stealth and  staying undetected matter then a silver ticket is probably a better  option than a golden ticket however the approach to creating one is the  exact same. The key difference between the two tickets is that a silver  ticket is limited to the service that is targeted whereas a golden  ticket has access to any Kerberos service.<br />A  specific use scenario for a silver ticket would be that you want to  access the domain&#39;s SQL server however your current compromised user  does not have access to that server. You can find an accessible service  account to get a foothold with by kerberoasting that service, you can  then dump the service hash and then impersonate their TGT in order to  request a service ticket for the SQL service from the KDC allowing you  access to the domain&#39;s SQL server.<br /><h2>KRBTGT Overview </h2><br />In  order to fully understand how these attacks work you need to understand  what the difference between a KRBTGT and a TGT is. A KRBTGT is the  service account for the KDC this is the Key Distribution Center that  issues all of the tickets to the clients. If you impersonate this  account and create a golden ticket form the KRBTGT you give yourself the  ability to create a service ticket for anything you want. A TGT is a  ticket to a service account issued by the KDC and can only access that  service the TGT is from like the SQLService ticket.<br /><h2>Golden/Silver Ticket Attack Overview - </h2><br />A  golden ticket attack works by dumping the ticket-granting ticket of any  user on the domain this would preferably be a domain admin however for a  golden ticket you would dump the krbtgt ticket and for a silver ticket,  you would dump any service or domain admin ticket. This will provide  you with the service/domain admin account&#39;s SID or security identifier  that is a unique identifier for each user account, as well as the NTLM  hash. You then use these details inside of a mimikatz golden ticket  attack in order to create a TGT that impersonates the given service  account information.<br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/GT1kkfo.png"><img src="images/72-1.png" alt="images/72-1.png" /></a><br /><h2>Dump the krbtgt hash -</h2><br />﻿1.) <code>cd downloads &amp;&amp; mimikatz.exe</code> - navigate to the directory mimikatz is in and run mimikatz<br />2.) <code>privilege::debug</code> - ensure this outputs [privilege &#39;20&#39; ok]<br />﻿3.) <code>lsadump::lsa /inject /name:krbtgt</code> -  This will dump the hash as well as the security identifier needed to  create a Golden Ticket. To create a silver ticket you need to change the  /name: to dump the hash of either a domain admin account or a service  account such as the SQLService account.<br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/VOEsU4O.png"><img src="images/72-2.png" alt="images/72-2.png" /></a><br /><br /><h2>Create a Golden/Silver Ticket - </h2><br />﻿1.) <code>Kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:controller.local /sid: /krbtgt: /id:</code> -  This is the command for creating a golden ticket to create a silver  ticket simply put a service NTLM hash into the krbtgt slot, the sid of  the service account into sid, and change the id to 1103.<br />I&#39;ll show you a demo of creating a golden ticket it is up to you to create a silver ticket.<br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/rh06qDl.png"><img src="images/72-3.png" alt="images/72-3.png" /></a><br /><h2>Use the Golden/Silver Ticket to access other machines -</h2><br />﻿1.) <code>misc::cmd</code> - this will open a new elevated command prompt with the given ticket in mimikatz.<br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/6HnEnwi.png"><img src="images/72-4.png" alt="images/72-4.png" /></a><br />2.)  Access machines that you want, what you can access will depend on the  privileges of the user that you decided to take the ticket from however  if you took the ticket from krbtgt you have access to the ENTIRE network  hence the name golden ticket; however, silver tickets only have access  to those that the user has access to if it is a domain admin it can  almost access the entire network however it is slightly less elevated  from a golden ticket.<br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/BSh4rXy.png"><img src="images/72-5.png" alt="images/72-5.png" /></a><br /><br />This  attack will not work without other machines on the domain however I  challenge you to configure this on your own network and try out these  attacks.<br /><br />        <br /></div></body></html>
