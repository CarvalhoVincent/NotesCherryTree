The  goal is to protect the environment from harmful malware and unapproved  software that does not align with the specific business needs of an  organization. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/what-is-applocker">AppLocker</a>  is Microsoft&#39;s application whitelisting solution and gives system  administrators control over which applications and files users can run.  It provides granular control over executables, scripts, Windows  installer files, DLLs, packaged apps, and packed app installers. It is  common for organizations to block cmd.exe and PowerShell.exe and write  access to certain directories, but this can all be bypassed.  Organizations also often focus on blocking the <code>PowerShell.exe</code> executable, but forget about the other <a href="https://www.powershelladmin.com/wiki/PowerShell_Executables_File_System_Locations">PowerShell executable locations</a> such as <code>%SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe</code> or <code>PowerShell_ISE.exe</code>. We can see that this is the case in the <code>AppLocker</code> rules shown below. All Domain Users are disallowed from running the 64-bit PowerShell executable located at:<br /><code>%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe</code><br />So, we can merely call it from other locations. Sometimes, we run into more stringent <code>AppLocker</code> policies that require more creativity to bypass. These ways will be covered in other modules.<br /><br /><h3>Using Get-AppLockerPolicy cmdlet</h3><br />                                                                                                Using Get-AppLockerPolicy cmdlet                <br />            <code>PS C:\htb&gt; Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective | select -ExpandProperty RuleCollections<br /><br />PathConditions      : {%SYSTEM32%\WINDOWSPOWERSHELL\V1.0\POWERSHELL.EXE}<br />PathExceptions      : {}<br />PublisherExceptions : {}<br />HashExceptions      : {}<br />Id                  : 3d57af4a-6cf8-4e5b-acfc-c2c2956061fa<br />Name                : Block PowerShell<br />Description         : Blocks Domain Users from using PowerShell on workstations<br />UserOrGroupSid      : S-1-5-21-2974783224-3764228556-2640795941-513<br />Action              : Deny<br /><br />PathConditions      : {%PROGRAMFILES%\*}<br />PathExceptions      : {}<br />PublisherExceptions : {}<br />HashExceptions      : {}<br />Id                  : 921cc481-6e17-4653-8f75-050b80acca20<br />Name                : (Default Rule) All files located in the Program Files folder<br />Description         : Allows members of the Everyone group to run applications that are located in the Program Files folder.<br />UserOrGroupSid      : S-1-1-0<br />Action              : Allow<br /><br />PathConditions      : {%WINDIR%\*}<br />PathExceptions      : {}<br />PublisherExceptions : {}<br />HashExceptions      : {}<br />Id                  : a61c8b2c-a319-4cd0-9690-d2177cad7b51<br />Name                : (Default Rule) All files located in the Windows folder<br />Description         : Allows members of the Everyone group to run applications that are located in the Windows folder.<br />UserOrGroupSid      : S-1-1-0<br />Action              : Allow<br /><br />PathConditions      : {*}<br />PathExceptions      : {}<br />PublisherExceptions : {}<br />HashExceptions      : {}<br />Id                  : fd686d83-a829-4351-8ff4-27c7de5755d2<br />Name                : (Default Rule) All files<br />Description         : Allows members of the local Administrators group to run all applications.<br />UserOrGroupSid      : S-1-5-32-544<br />Action              : Allow<br /></code><br /><br /><br /><h2>PowerShell Constrained Language Mode</h2><br />PowerShell <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-constrained-language-mode/">Constrained Language Mode</a>  locks down many of the features needed to use PowerShell effectively,  such as blocking COM objects, only allowing approved .NET types,  XAML-based workflows, PowerShell classes, and more. We can quickly  enumerate whether we are in Full Language Mode or Constrained Language  Mode.<br /><br /><h3>Enumerating Language Mode</h3><br />                                                                                                Enumerating Language Mode                <br />            <code>PS C:\htb&gt; $ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode<br /><br />ConstrainedLanguage<br /></code><br /><br /><br /><h2>LAPS</h2><br />The Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899">Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)</a>  is used to randomize and rotate local administrator passwords on  Windows hosts and prevent lateral movement. We can enumerate what domain  users can read the LAPS password set for machines with LAPS installed  and what machines do not have LAPS installed. The <a href="https://github.com/leoloobeek/LAPSToolkit">LAPSToolkit</a> greatly facilitates this with several functions. One is parsing <code>ExtendedRights</code>  for all computers with LAPS enabled. This will show groups specifically  delegated to read LAPS passwords, which are often users in protected  groups. An account that has joined a computer to a domain receives <code>All Extended Rights</code>  over that host, and this right gives the account the ability to read  passwords. Enumeration may show a user account that can read the LAPS  password on a host. This can help us target specific AD users who can  read LAPS passwords.<br /><br /><h3>Using Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups</h3><br />                                                                                                Using Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups                <br />            <code>PS C:\htb&gt; Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups<br /><br />OrgUnit                                             Delegated Groups<br />-------                                             ----------------<br />OU=Servers,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL                INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins<br />OU=Servers,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL                INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins<br />OU=Workstations,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL           INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins<br />OU=Workstations,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL           INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins<br />OU=Web Servers,OU=Servers,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins<br />OU=Web Servers,OU=Servers,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins<br />OU=SQL Servers,OU=Servers,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins<br />OU=SQL Servers,OU=Servers,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins<br />OU=File Servers,OU=Servers,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=L...
