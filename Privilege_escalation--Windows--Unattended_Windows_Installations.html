These  kinds of installations are referred to as unattended installations as  they don&#39;t require user interaction. Such installations require the use  of an administrator account to perform the initial setup, which might  end up being stored in the machine in the following locations:<br />• C:\Unattend.xml<br />• C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml<br />• C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend\Unattend.xml<br />• C:\Windows\system32\sysprep.inf<br />• C:\Windows\system32\sysprep\sysprep.xml<br /><br />As part of these files, you might encounter credentials:<br /><code>&lt;Credentials&gt;<br />    &lt;Username&gt;Administrator&lt;/Username&gt;<br />    &lt;Domain&gt;thm.local&lt;/Domain&gt;<br />    &lt;Password&gt;MyPassword123&lt;/Password&gt;<br />&lt;/Credentials&gt;</code><br /><br /><br /><h2>Powershell History</h2><br />Whenever a user runs a command using Powershell, it gets stored into a  file that keeps a memory of past commands. This is useful for repeating  commands you have used before quickly. If a user runs a command that  includes a password directly as part of the Powershell command line, it  can later be retrieved by using the following command from a <code>cmd.exe</code> prompt:<br /><code>type %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt</code><strong>Note:</strong> The command above will only work from cmd.exe, as Powershell won&#39;t recognize <code>%userprofile%</code> as an environment variable. To read the file from Powershell, you&#39;d have to replace <code>%userprofile%</code> with <code>$Env:userprofile</code>. <br /><br /><br /><br /><h2>Saved Windows Credentials</h2><br />Windows allows us to use other users&#39; credentials. This function also  gives the option to save these credentials on the system. The command  below will list saved credentials:<br /><code>cmdkey /list</code>While you can&#39;t see the actual passwords, if you notice any credentials worth trying, you can use them with the <code>runas</code> command and the <code>/savecred</code> option, as seen below.<br /><code>runas /savecred /user:admin cmd.exe</code><br /><br /><br /><h2>IIS Configuration</h2><br />Internet Information Services (IIS) is the default web server on  Windows installations. The configuration of websites on IIS is stored in  a file called <code>web.config</code> and can store passwords for  databases or configured authentication mechanisms. Depending on the  installed version of IIS, we can find web.config in one of the following  locations:<br />◇ C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config<br />◇ C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config<br /><br />Here is a quick way to find database connection strings on the file:<br /><code>type C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config | findstr connectionString</code><br /><br /><br /><h2>Retrieve Credentials from Software: PuTTY</h2><br />PuTTY is an SSH client commonly found on Windows systems. Instead of  having to specify a connection&#39;s parameters every single time, users can  store sessions where the IP, user and other configurations can be  stored for later use. While PuTTY won&#39;t allow users to store their SSH  password, it will store proxy configurations that include cleartext  authentication credentials.<br />To retrieve the stored proxy credentials, you can search under the  following registry key for ProxyPassword with the following command:<br /><code>reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\ /f &quot;Proxy&quot; /s</code><strong>Note:</strong> Simon Tatham is the creator of PuTTY (and his name is  part of the path), not the username for which we are retrieving the  password. The stored proxy username should also be visible after running  the command above.<br />Just as putty stores credentials, any software that stores passwords, including browsers, email clients, FTP clients, SSH clients, VNC software and others, will have methods to recover any passwords the user has saved.<br /></div></body></html>
