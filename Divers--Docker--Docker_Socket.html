    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Docker Socket</h1><br/>             This task will explain  how Docker interacts between the operating system and the container.  When you install Docker, there are two programs that get installed:<br />1. The Docker Client<br />2. The Docker Server<br />Docker  works in a client/server model. Specifically, these two programs  communicate with each other to form the Docker that we know and love.  Docker achieves this communication using something called a socket.  Sockets are an essential feature of the operating system that allows  data to be communicated. <br />For example, when using a chat program, there could be two sockets:<br />1. A socket for storing a message that you are sending<br />2. A socket for storing a message that someone is sending you.<br />The  program will interact with these two sockets to store or retrieve the  data within them! A socket can either be a network connection or what is  represented as a file. What&#39;s important to know about sockets is that  they allow for Interprocess Communication (IPC). This simply means that  processes on an operating system can communicate with each other!<br /> In the context of Docker, the Docker Server is effectively just an API. The Docker Server uses this API to <strong>listen </strong>for requests, whereas the Docker Client uses the API to <strong>send</strong> requests.<br />For example, let&#39;s take this command: <code>docker run helloworld</code>.  The Docker Client will request the Docker server to run a container  using the image &quot;helloworld&quot;. Now, whilst this explanation is fairly  basic, it is the essential premise of how Docker works.<br />Let&#39;s look at the following diagram to show this process in action:<br /><a href="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/7ef5f80912c890645b102b28a23b9b8b.png"><img src="images/85-1.png" alt="images/85-1.png" /></a><br />What&#39;s interesting is that because of this, we can interact with the Docker Server using commands like <code>curl</code>  or an API developer tool such as Postman. Now, using this is out of the  scope for this room, but I&#39;ll demonstrate communicating with the Docker  Server using Postman to list all images that are stored on the  operating system:<br /><a href="https://resources.cmnatic.co.uk/TryHackMe/rooms/docker-rodeo/dockerregistry/catalog1.png"><img src="images/85-2.png" alt="images/85-2.png" /></a><br />Finally,  it&#39;s important to note that because of this, the host machine running  Docker can be configured to process commands sent from another device.  This is an extremely dangerous vulnerability if it is not correctly  configured because it means someone can remotely stop, start, and access  Docker containers. Despite this, there are use cases where this feature  of Docker is extremely helpful! We will cover this in further detail in  a later room!<br /><br />        <br /></div></body></html>
